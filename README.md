## Dart-SDK for Chat GPT

<b>ChatGPTAPI</b> which provides an API wrapper around OpenAIâ€™s text completion API using the ChatGPT model using dart.

## Development: TODO

To use ChatGPT, you will need an OpenAI API key. You can apply for one on the OpenAI website. Once you have the API key, you can start making requests to the ChatGPT API.

The link to sign up for an OpenAI API key is [https://beta.openai.com/signup/](https://beta.openai.com/signup/)

- [ ] Sign up for an OpenAI API key to access the API endpoint for ChatGPT model.( Yet to be launched so joined waitlist will use leaked api model for testing purpose ).
- [ ] Create Dart code that calls the API endpoint, passing it text to be generated, and returning the generated text.
- [ ] Package the code as a Dart library, following the guidelines for creating Dart packages.
- [ ] Publish the package to the pub.dev package repository.
